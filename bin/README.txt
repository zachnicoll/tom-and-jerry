GOAL:
Collect cheese as Jerry ('J' on screen) while avoiding Tom ('T' on screen).
After 5 cheese ('<' on screen) have been picked up on the CURRENT LEVEL, a door will
appear ('X' on screen) that advances you to the next level. Avoid the traps
('#' on screen) that Tom automatically places.
If there are no more levels, the game ends and you can either restart or quit.

After Level 1:
Tom automatically seeks Jerry, but Jerry can shoot fireworks by pressing 'F' that home in on Tom.
Players can be switched by pressing 'Z', allowing you to play as Tom.
Tom can place traps manually by pressing 'M', and place cheese manually by pressing 'C'.
A maximum of 5 cheese and 5 traps can be on screen at once. Jerry is lured by cheese
when it comes within a 10 unit radius, and runs away from Tom when he is within a 5 unit
radius. Jerry will also shoot a firework every 5 seconds.

Scoring:
(As Jerry)
Cheese = 1 point
Hitting Tom with Firework = 1 point

(As Tom)
Catching Jerry = 5 points
Jerry Caught by Trap = 1 point
